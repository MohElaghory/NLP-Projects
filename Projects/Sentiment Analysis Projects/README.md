Sentiment analysis is used to analyze raw text to drive objective quantitative results using natural language processing, machine learning, and other data analytics techniques. It is used to detect positive or negative sentiment in text, and often businesses use it to gauge branded reputation among their customers. 

There are various types of sentiment analysis where the models focus on feelings and emotions, urgency, even intentions, and polarity. The most popular types of sentiment analysis are:

a. Fine-grained sentiment analysis

b. Emotion detection

c. Aspect based sentiment analysis

d. Multilingual sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis is critical because it helps businesses to understand the emotion and sentiments of their customers. Companies analyze customers’ sentiment through social media conversations and reviews so they can make better-informed decisions. The Global Sentiment Analysis Software Market is projected to reach US$4.3 billion by the year 2027. Between 2017 and 2023, the global sentiment analysis market will increase by a CAGR of 14%. 

The overall benefits of sentiment analysis include:

**Sorting Data at Scale:** With sentiment analysis, companies don't have to sort through customer support conversations manually, thousands of tweets, and surveys. Sentiment analysis helps businesses process vast amounts of data efficiently.

**Real-Time Analysis:** It helps to identify critical issues in real-time. For example, is a crisis on social media escalating? Is there an angry customer about to churn? With Sentiment analysis models, businesses can immediately identify customer pain points and take action right away.

**Consistent criteria:** A centralized sentiment analysis system can improve accuracy and deliver better insights since tagging text by sentiment is highly subjective, influenced by personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs.
